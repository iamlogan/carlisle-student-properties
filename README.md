## Purpose

* To advertise a family member's business.
* To showcase my web development skills.

## Key Points

* It's a static site with fixed content.
* The code is written in HTML with minimal CSS, as the formatting is mostly powered by [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).
* This website is responsive - it has to look good on mobile devices, as clients are most likely viewing the site using a mobile device.
* A deployment service is used to pull from GitHub and upload to the web server whenever I push to the repository.
