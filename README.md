# Carlisle Student Properties

Here you'll find the source code for [carlislestudentproperties.com](https://www.carlislestudentproperties.com), a website I created several years ago and been maintaining ever since.

## Purpose

1. To advertise a family member's business.
2. To showcase my web development skills.

## Key Points

* __Code__ - this is a static site with fixed content, written in HTML with minimal CSS, as the formatting is almost entirely powered by [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap). 
* __Content__ - this wesbite is comprised of a Home page, several property details pages, and an About page.
* __Responsive__ - as clients are most likely viewing the site using a mobile device, this website needs look good on mobile devices,  so the size and shape of elements change depending on client's display size (most notably the navigation bar)
* __Usability__ - this website features a navigation bar, consistent across all pages, which contains a drop-down list. 
* __SEO friendly__ - optimised by design for search engine compatibility, this website and the associated business entity appear in Google search results.
* __Deployment__ - DeployHQ is used to automatically pull from GitHub and upload to the web server whenever I push commits to this repository.
